Hi Jeroen and Hom Nath,

Sure, Zhinan is working hard on that. PML in the 2D code is now 100%
clean, and Zhinan is about to be done with the 3D version as well; that
was a significant amount of work because it turns out that designing a
clean CPML for the weak form of the equation is difficult. However that
is now done, it is just a matter of cleaning the source code (Zhinan is
on it).

As soon as he is 100% done we'll send you an email.

Thanks,
Dimitri.

Dear Dimitri, dear all,

Thank you so much for understanding my delay in work of SPECFEM source development.
I would like to summarize some previous email about the missing things
in SPECFEM that need further some research work and things have been done but do not committed in SPECFEM:


Missing things:

(1): The PML formulation and implementation for wave simulation in Chunk of earth with SPECFEM_globe.

(2): The computational part of PML code in SPECFEM2D and SPCFEM3D_Cartesian is not well documented and also not clean, in
particular for adjoint wave simulation.

(3): make the PML code work with inner_mesher in SPCFEM3D_Cartesian.

(4): The LDDRK scheme implementation in SPCFEM3D_Cartesian.

(5): plane wave incident with PML in case of layered infinite domain.


Uncommitted things (or committed some unclean code):

(1): PML implementation in SPECFEM2D and SPCFEM3D_Cartesian for forward and adjoint acoustic/elastic simulation with source excitation.

(2): boundary kernel computation with PML.

(3): plane wave incident with PML in case of uniform infinite domain.


Also some problems have been reported and already realized by the team of developers:

(1): The SPECFEM2D code is not clean due to many development.

(2): some examples in SPECFEM2D are broken, such as the nice example done by LuoYang: noise_layered and noise_uniform.

(3): an clean adjoint inversion example with PML.

Thanks,
Best regards,
Zhinan

Hi Chang-hua,

PS: please note that more traditionally we tend to indicate "no
attenuation" with a test such as Q > 9999. rather than Q < 0.0001 or Q == 0;
this is because low values of Q mean high attenuation, thus no
attenuation means Q tending to infinity rather than to zero.

Thus, in the whole code tests such as

if (Q_mu <=1.e-5) cycle

should be changed to   if(Q > 9999.) then

and if the code detects Q = 0   (or Q < 1.e-5) in an input file it
should instead stop with an error message, since a Q = 0 (or close to
zero) value would be physically meaningless.

Thanks,
Best regards,

Hi Dimitri and Zhinan,

Now I have done more tests, and it seems to me that by choosing Qs=35 in the example (homogeneous_halfspace_HEX8_elastic_absorbing_CPML_5sides) is not appropriate because of the large element size, or the large resolved period. By creating a small element size (25 m) homogenous model, and Qs=35, the spike appearing in the snap shot shown in slide 5 disappears. So only the PML needs to be fix, which I have done that.

There are two more bugs:
1)  The solver crashes for an acoustic-elastic coupling model with PML because of the reallocating an allocated arrays in  pml_allocate_arrays_dummy(). In order to fix it, I have replaced the "call  pml_allocate_arrays_dummy()" with if(.not.PML_CONDITIONS) call pml_allocate_arrays_dummy() in prepare_timerun.F90

2)  There is no Q_kappa input in the mesh_file for the internal mesher. Therefore, the "if (Q_kappa <=1.e-5) cycle" statement in get_attenuation_model.f90  always works, and not attenuation for both S and P waves even Q_mu is given. I think neither "if (Q_kappa <=1.e-5) cycle"  nor "if (Q_mu <=1.e-5) cycle" serves the purpose if Q=0 means no attenuation.

So my conclusion is that attenuation and CPML can now be both turned on.

Chang-hua

Hi Chang-hua,

Yes, you are right, in the current 3D code there is always this problem
that attenuation and PML cannot be turned on simultaneously (Zhinan will
soon remove that (unneeded, as you pointed out) constraint based on your
suggestions.

What Zhinan meant below in that in the 2D that unneeded constraint is
not present and then when you use both viscoelasticity in the main
domain and PML you get correct matching and correct absorption if Q is
moderate (above 70 or so), however for very strong attenuation (Q below
50 or so) then you start to see spurious reflections from the edge
between the PML and the main domain because the main domain is
viscoelastic but the PML is only elastic, thus there is a jump from Q =
50 or so in the domain to Q = infinity in the PML, and that jump acts as
an interface (an interface between two layers with different Q
properties) that generates low-frequency reflections, as an absorbing
sponge would do.

Thus, in practice, using an elastic PML in contact with a viscoelastic
domain leads to good results for moderate or low attenuation, but to
results that start to show spurious reflections if attenuation is high

(and that is normal; the only clean solution would be to implement PML
for viscoelastic materials inside the PML, but as you said in your email
that is complicated)

Best regards,
Dimitri.

Hi Zhinan,

If I understand correctly, the stress tensor T_ij in the CPML region is not symmetric any more, that is, Txy /= Tyx.  Therefore, in the code, pml_compute_memory_variables.f90, the duxdy (labeled by duxdy_y) for calculating Txy is not the same duxdy (labeled as duxdy_x) as for Tyx. This label convention is fine for isotropic case. However, for the anisotropic case, this is not convenient because the derivatives and the PML memory functions are the same for calculating for example for T_xx, Txy and Txz, but different for Txx, Tyx and Tzx.  If I use the the original convention as in the code, I need rmemory_duxdy_dx for calculating T_xx, rmemory_duxdy_dy for T_xy, and rmemory_duxdy_dz for Txz. After I relabel them, just rmemory_duxdy_dx is needed for all T_xx, Txy and Txz. Now this is just an example. The other stress components are dealt with the same idea. Hope this can clarity.

Yes, I understand that the CPML region is treated as elastic. This is understandable again because of the asymmetric of the strain and stress in the CPML region. I actually have tried to see if I can use viscoelastic in the CPML, but get pretty messy, so I have to give up.

When you said you had tested for Q not too small case, what do you mean? Isn't that true that the result is not correct when both CPML and attenuation are turned on, as shown in my slides?

Of cause you can use my idea to reduce the memory cost in CPML implementation. I should thank you guys for that open source code, and I am happy to contribute to it.

Chang-hua

Dear Chang hua and Dimitri,

Chang hua, first, thank you so much for your comment in CPML
  implementation in SPECFEM2D, which is not optimized.
As you have already seen that we waste a lot of memory.
If you do not mind, I will use your idea to reduce the memory cost in
CPML implementation.

I do not get your point of following paragraph

Redefine the CPML memory variables: CPML memory variables for
calculation of Txx, Txy, and Txzare labeled by _x, and for Tyx, Tyy, and
Tyzlabeled by _y, and for Tzx, Tzy, and Tzzlabeled by _z. These
redefinitions are convenient and necessary for the extension to the
anisotropic case.

Could you please make it more clear? I am new to anisotropic wave equations.

Concerning the CPML in 3D do not work for viscoelastic wave simulation.
We will fix that. But the way we current use is that we will use a PML
formulated on basis of elastic wave equation to absorb the outgoing wave
from interior domain governed by viscoelastic wave equation.

Though the way is poor, it works when the Q is not too low. We have
tested for Q>70, the result is quite well.

Thank you so much.

Zhinan

And similarly the other places, the results are much better, but I have

Hi,

Yes, PML in the 3D code is currently for acoustic/elastic media only
(i.e. viscoelasticity cannot be turned on).

Let me cc my colleague Zhinan Xie because he is currently working on the
code and thus he could probably remove that constraint (note that if so
PML will *not* be perfectly matched strictly speaking because it is
written without attenuation, thus the viscoelastic medium will be in
contact with an elastic PML; but that works fine in practice if Q
factors are not too small (typically not below 50 or so).

PS for Zhinan: Zhang Ksu is right, there is no reason to stop the code
in that case, we should just run with an elastic PML in contact with the
viscoelastic medium, as we do in the 2D code. Thus the code in his email
below should be slightly modified (and the PML arrays should be
allocated even if attenuation is on I guess).

Thanks,
Dimitri.

For SPECFEM3D PMLs:
-------------------

1/ add PML support to the internal mesher and also PML support for adjoint runs, see https://github.com/geodynamics/specfem3d/issues/312

Regarding PML for SPECFEM3D, what is currently missing is:

- support for the internal mesher

- support for adjoint runs; the current code works fine for forward runs but cannot time-revert the field inside the PML for SIMULATION_TYPE = 3 (when done directly that is unstable because total energy is not conserved, as for viscoelasticity). That is easy to solve by storing the inner edge of the PML instead of the outer edge and thus not back-propagating anything inside the PML itself; Zhinan has already implemented that successfully in the 2D code two years ago, but it is not cut and pasted in the 3D code yet.

Let us add both options.

Hi Zhinan,

OK, thank you very much for your answer. I suggest we proceed as you
plan below, i.e. in the next few days you can start cleaning the code
(please do a git pull because Clement and Yi as well as Vadim have
changed many things in the code)  and you can start merging all your
contributions from the last few months, which are not committed yet.
Then, as soon as all of this is merged Vadim can have a look at how to
use PML for adjoint problems

(as we discussed, what is needed is to store the wave field on the inner
edge of the PML layers)

If you have a working version of that for the 2D code you can tell
Vadim, from the 2D code Vadim could then guess how to implement that in
the 3D code as well.

Thanks again,
Best wishes,

Dimitri.

4/ add support for the LDDRK time scheme in addition to Newmark; that is easy to do because LDDRK is already implemented in SPECFEM3D_GLOBE (using the flag USE_LDDRK), thus it would be easy to cut and paste it from there. That would be extremely useful because for fluid/solid media (for instance in ocean acoustics) we will often need high accuracy.

Hi Zhinan and Rene,

What do you think of the approach of Bermudez et al (2007) to make the
damping profile linear and also reach zero on the outer edge of the
domain in order to reduce the number of damping parameters to adjust in
the PML model? (i.e. when doing so the only thing to optimize / to
choose is the thickness of the PML, but there is no more damping profile
to choose / to optimize for).
