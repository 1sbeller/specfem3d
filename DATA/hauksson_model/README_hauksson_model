As of June 2010, the Hauksson-2000 model has been replaced by the Lin-2007 model as the background tomographic model for southern California simulations.

In order to implement the Hauksson-2000 model, the following changes should be made.

1. In create_regions_mesh.f90, uncomment the call to the Hauksson (2000) model and comment the call to the Lin et al. (2007) model.

    call get_value_string(HAUKSSON_REGIONAL_MODEL_FILE, &
                          'model.HAUKSSON_REGIONAL_MODEL_FILE', &
                          'DATA/hauksson_model/hauksson_final_grid_smooth.dat')
!    call get_value_string(HAUKSSON_REGIONAL_MODEL_FILE, &
!                          'model.HAUKSSON_REGIONAL_MODEL_FILE', &
!                          'DATA/lin_model/lin_final_grid_smooth.dat')


2. In constants.h.in, uncomment the block of lines beginning with "Hauksson (2000)" and comment the block of lines beginning with "Lin-Shearer-Hauksson-Thurber (2007)". These minor differences are due to the differences in the input models.

3. cp ./hauksson_model.f90 ../../
   This modified file accounts for the 9 layers of the Hauksson model, rather than the 8 layers of the Lin model.

See the the PDF files in DATA/lin_model/ to examine the differences between the parameterizations of the two tomographic models.
