This folder contains several examples with increasing complexities.


To familiarize yourself with the package and CUBIT support, 
we suggest to start with:

- homogeneous_halfspace/: a model with a single constant material description.

  please follow the homogeneous_halfspace/README for detailed instructions
  how to run a simulation.

More complex examples are provided in:

- layered_halfspace/: a model with different material layers used for benchmarking

- waterlayered_halfspace/: a model with fluid-solid coupling

- tomographic_model/: a model used together with of a tomographic file for the material description

- noise_tomography/: uses the homogeneous_halfspace model for noise kernel simulations



To familiarize yourself with the new in-house mesher xmeshfem3D (no CUBIT needed),
you can follow the examples in:

- meshfem3d_examples/ 


please consider submitting your own example to this package!
